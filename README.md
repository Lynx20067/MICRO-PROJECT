# *Integrated Capstone Microproject – Virus Spread Simulator 🦠*

---

## *1. Objective *

Simulate virus spread in a population using a *Queue (FIFO)* to track infection and recovery. Analyze virus progression under different CPU conditions, collect statistical data, and demonstrate real-world application in epidemiology and pandemic modeling.

---

## *2. Data Structure Concept *

*Queue* – to model people waiting to be infected or recover.

---

## *3. Applied Computer Organization Concept 🖥*

Simulated three CPU types for performance:

* *Basic* – slower processing for large populations
* *Mid* – medium speed
* *Pro* – fast processing with minimal delay

Each CPU type adds artificial delay to reflect hardware performance in processing infection/recovery events.

---

## *4. Applied Probability & Statistics Concept 📈*

* Randomized infection chance per person per day
* Track *infected, recovered, mortality rates, and **mean infection duration*
* Calculate *average infection time* and *standard deviation*

---

## *5. Used OOP Concepts 🧱*

* *Encapsulation:* Classes Person, Virus, Population encapsulate data and behavior
* *Inheritance:* Person class may be extended for different susceptibility types
* *Polymorphism:* Methods for infection, recovery, and mortality can vary depending on person or virus type

## *10. Conclusion 📘*

This project demonstrates how a virus can spread in a population using *Queue-based modeling* and *OOP design*. CPU simulation shows how processing speed affects simulation time for different population sizes. Statistics provide insight into infection, recovery, and mortality rates. This mirrors real-world pandemic analysis and helps understand epidemiological patterns.
